**Business Value of this Project**

To discover all mentions and sentiments related to McDonaldâ€™s new burger product on Twitter, for instant Brand Reputation and Competitive Analysis.

It also offers valuables insights into Marketing Strategies, Product Development and Crisis Detection.

## What is in this repo?

* `Graph` contains all the visualizations made for analysis of sentiment and most popular topics.
* `data` contains csv files that store dataframes with cleaned tweets and relevant features.
* `main` contains notebooks that complete steps - from data acquisition, preprocessing, visualisation, transfer learning of LSTM model. 
* `LSTM_TwitterSentiment` contains a notebook that train the full LSTM model. 
* `TwitterListening_PPT.pdf` is a powerpoint which illustrates the complete framework of this project.



## How did we collect the data?
We used Tweepy, an easy-to-use Python library for accessing the Twitter API, and passing in relevant parameters such as - search words, language and number of tweets - to specify the items returned. 

The search words represent the areas we would like to analyse on: McDonald's and its biggest competitors, plant-based meat market and the plant-based product market.

## What did we do the Text Cleaning?
We executed some common text pre-processing steps, and handle special cases at a later point to improve our results.

## Language Model Training
### Dataset
We used Sentiment-140 dataset from Kaggle. It contains a labelled data of 1.6 million tweets and we found it a good amount of data to train our model.

### Word Embedding
In language models, words are represented in a way to intend more meaning for pattern and contextual learning.Word Embedding is one of the popular representation of document vocabulary, which is capable of capturing context, semantic similarity of a word, and its relation with other words.

After text preprocessing, we applied transfer learning of GloVe, one of the pre-trained word embedding for word classification.

Finally adopted LSTM Model with 3 epochs trained, which performed highest validation accuracy and least loss.
