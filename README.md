## How did we collect the data?
We used Tweepy, an easy-to-use Python library for accessing the Twitter API, and passing in relevant parameters, such as search words, language and number of tweets to specify the items returned. The search words represent the areas we would like to analyse on, which include McDonald's competitors, plant-based meat market and the plant-based product market.
